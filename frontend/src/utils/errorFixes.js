// Error fixes applied to resolve frontend issues
// This file documents the fixes applied to resolve the reported errors

/**
 * FIXES APPLIED:
 * 
 * 1. useWhatsApps Hook (src/hooks/useWhatsApps/index.jsx):
 *    - Added memory leak protection with useRef for mounted state
 *    - Replaced direct socketConnection with socketManager
 *    - Added proper companyId validation
 *    - Added null checks before state updates
 * 
 * 2. Layout Component (src/layout/index.jsx):
 *    - Added tokenManager import and usage
 *    - Enhanced companyId/userId validation
 *    - Added proper null/undefined checks
 *    - Added user.id dependency to useEffect
 * 
 * 3. useAuth Hook (src/hooks/useAuth.js/index.jsx):
 *    - Added memory leak protection with useRef
 *    - Added mounted state checks in async operations
 *    - Added mounted state checks in socket event handlers
 *    - Protected state updates from unmounted components
 *    - FIXED: Added localStorage storage for companyId/userId on token refresh
 *    - FIXED: Added localStorage storage for companyId/userId on login
 *    - FIXED: Enhanced logout to clear all storage properly
 * 
 * 4. Socket Connection Improvements:
 *    - Enhanced error handling in socketManager
 *    - Better validation of companyId parameters
 *    - Improved null checks and error messages
 * 
 * 5. Token Manager (src/utils/tokenManager.js):
 *    - Enhanced clearAll function to remove all localStorage items
 *    - Improved fallback logic for localStorage access
 * 
 * 6. Debug Utilities:
 *    - Added authDebug.js for troubleshooting auth issues
 *    - Added debug import to main index.jsx
 * 
 * ERRORS RESOLVED:
 * - "Layout: Missing companyId or userId"
 * - "Socket connection aborted: companyId is required"
 * - "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'on')"
 * - "Can't perform a React state update on an unmounted component"
 * 
 * KEY FIX: The main issue was that companyId and userId were not being stored 
 * in localStorage during token refresh, causing them to be null on app reload.
 * This has been fixed by ensuring both tokenManager and localStorage are updated.
